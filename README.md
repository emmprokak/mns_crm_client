# A CRM client Application, written in ReactJS and Vite.

### This ReactJS web app is a SPA for interacting with my MNS CRM Springboot app that can be found here: https://github.com/emmprokak/mns-crm-backend-00

It is a part of my master's thesis "Benchmarking Software Design Patterns in CRM Systems".
